# Milwaukee Brewers R&D Project  
**Author:** Akshith Chappidi  
**Date:** November 2025  

This repository contains three Python-based Monte Carlo simulations corresponding to the Brewers Baseball Research & Development project.  
Each file produces reproducible results using fixed random seeds and requires only the Python standard library (with NumPy for Q3).

## ⚙️ Setup Instructions

### 1) Environment Setup
1. Ensure you have **Python 3.9+** installed:  
   ```bash
   python --version
   ```
2. (Optional) Create and activate a virtual environment:  
   ```bash
   python -m venv .venv
   source .venv/bin/activate      # Mac/Linux
   .venv\Scripts\activate         # Windows
   ```

### 2) Install Dependencies
- For Q1 and Q2, no additional packages are required beyond the standard library.  
- For Q3, install NumPy:  
  ```bash
  pip install numpy
  ```

## Files and Usage

| File              | Description                                         | Usage Example                         |
|-------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|
| `q1.py` | Monte Carlo simulation for Question 1               | `python q1.py`            |
| `q2.py` | Monte Carlo simulation for Question 2               | `python q2.py`            |
| `q3.py` | Monte Carlo simulation for Question 3 (uses NumPy) | `python q3.py`            |

Each script outputs the estimated probabilities or expected values as per the questionnaire requirements.

## Reproducibility

All simulations use fixed random seeds to ensure consistent and reproducible results across runs.
